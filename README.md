Custom File Encryption/Decryption Tool

ðŸ”’ Secure File Encryption/Decryption Tool (AES-256)

A command-line utility in Python for advanced file encryption and decryption. It employs AES-256 symmetric encryption with robust PBKDF2 key derivation from a user-defined passphrase, ensuring strong data confidentiality.

âœ¨ Features

* Encrypts files using AES-256 in CBC mode.
* Securely derives keys from passwords using PBKDF2 with SHA256.
* Generates unique cryptographic salts and Initialization Vectors (IVs) per encryption.
* Supports large files by processing data in chunks.
* Includes comprehensive error handling for file operations and password validation.

ðŸ’» Technologies

* Python 3.x
* cryptography library (AES, PBKDF2, padding primitives)
* secrets module (Cryptographically strong randomness)

ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (ensure encrypt_tool.py is present).
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (as above).
3. Install dependencies:
4. pip install cryptography

5. Run the tool:
6. python encrypt_tool.py

Follow the interactive prompts to encrypt or decrypt files.
